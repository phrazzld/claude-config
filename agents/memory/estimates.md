## Key Success Factors for Rapid Execution

### Pattern Discovery Acceleration:
- **Always use pattern-scout first** before any implementation
- Pattern-scout with 98% confidence = trivial implementation (1-5 minutes)
- Exact directory structure + import patterns = VERY_SIMPLE
- Pattern discovery prevents reinventing solutions
- Pattern-scout finding exact component locations = accurate SIMPLE estimates
- **Comprehensive pattern templates enable multi-task completion** - when patterns cover validation, error handling, and integration structure, multiple related tasks can be completed efficiently
- **Task dependency recognition from patterns** - pattern-scout reveals logical dependencies (internal mutations before actions)
- **High-confidence UI patterns (93%+)** - enable accurate SIMPLE estimates for complex filtering/sorting interfaces
- **Well-organized existing structure assessment** - pattern-scout confidence levels indicate if refactoring will be straightforward

### Environment Setup Patterns:
- Single-command configuration (e.g., `npx convex env set KEY value`) = instant success
- Well-documented CLI tools with clear commands = no friction
- Environment validation patterns prevent runtime issues

### Code Structure Recognition:
- Existing directory conventions (/convex/actions/) indicate maturity
- Generated TypeScript definitions (_generated/server.d.ts) provide exact patterns
- Clear import patterns (import { action } from "../_generated/server") reduce complexity

### Component Integration Success Factors:
- Existing modal components ready for integration = SIMPLE
- Backend mutations already implemented = no blocking dependencies
- AlertDialog patterns can be adapted = reusable confirmation flows
- TypeScript type checking catches ID field mismatches = safe refactoring

- **Badge variant adaptation** - TypeScript catches incompatible variants early
- **Empty state differentiation** - "no data" vs "filtered results" patterns established
- **Search icon positioning** - absolute positioning with consistent padding patterns
- **Client-side filtering optimization** - useMemo dependency patterns prevent performance issues

### Component Organization Success Factors:
