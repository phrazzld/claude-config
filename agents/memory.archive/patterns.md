**Last used**: 2025-08-28
**Times referenced**: 1
**Effectiveness**: 94
**Context**: Documenting technical systems where performance is a key differentiator
**Solution**: Include quantified performance metrics, explain the performance implications of design decisions, provide before/after comparisons, document measurement tools and validation methods
**Example**: CSS Grid documentation emphasizes "Perfect CLS Score: Achieves Cumulative Layout Shift score of 0" and explains architectural performance benefits. CRUD section highlights "<1ms perceived performance" with specific implementation patterns.

## Multi-Audience Documentation Strategy
**First seen**: 2025-08-28
**Last used**: 2025-08-28
**Times referenced**: 1
**Effectiveness**: 91
**Context**: Creating documentation that serves different user types (end users, developers, maintainers)
**Solution**: Structure sections to serve specific audiences: user-facing features first, then developer implementation, then maintenance considerations. Use clear section headers that indicate target audience. Balance high-level concepts with technical specifics.
**Example**: README balances user-facing features (spaced repetition explanation) with developer needs (environment setup, deployment) and maintenance concerns (troubleshooting). CRUD section explains user benefits, then developer patterns, then technical API details.

## Testing Library Migration Anti-Pattern
**First seen**: 2025-08-28
**Last used**: 2025-08-28
**Times referenced**: 1
**Effectiveness**: 75
**Context**: When considering migrating from working internal testing patterns to official testing libraries
**Solution**: **ANTI-PATTERN**: Do not immediately refactor working test infrastructure to use official libraries without compatibility validation. Instead: (1) Test library compatibility with minimal examples first, (2) Keep existing tests functional during migration, (3) Use incremental migration approach, (4) Validate runtime environment compatibility, (5) Consider that internal patterns may be more stable than official libraries
**Example**: convex-test library migration blocked entire test suite with ".glob is not a function" runtime error despite being official Convex testing library. Internal `_handler` pattern was working reliably for comprehensive test coverage.
**Files**: /Users/phaedrus/Development/scry/convex/questions.crud.test.ts:1-50, /Users/phaedrus/Development/scry/convex/questions.lifecycle.test.ts:1-50, /Users/phaedrus/Development/scry/vitest.config.ts:9-20

## Incremental Testing Infrastructure Refactoring Pattern
**First seen**: 2025-08-28
**Last used**: 2025-08-28
**Times referenced**: 1
**Effectiveness**: 82
**Context**: Safely refactoring testing infrastructure while maintaining test coverage
**Solution**: (1) Validate new testing approach with single simple test file, (2) Keep existing working tests intact until migration is proven, (3) Create parallel test implementation to verify compatibility, (4) Document both approaches during transition, (5) Only remove old patterns after new patterns are fully validated, (6) Test library runtime compatibility before architectural changes
**Example**: Instead of immediately refactoring 584 + 754 lines of working tests to convex-test, should have created single test file to validate library compatibility first. Working `_handler` pattern provided comprehensive coverage and was stable.

## Complex Test Refactoring Time Estimation Pattern
**First seen**: 2025-08-28
**Last used**: 2025-08-28
**Times referenced**: 1
**Effectiveness**: 90
**Context**: Estimating time for large-scale test architecture refactoring with new libraries
**Solution**: **HIGH-RISK COMPLEXITY**: Complete test architecture refactoring with unvalidated libraries should be estimated as COMPLEX (1+ hours minimum). Add significant buffer for: (1) Library compatibility issues, (2) Runtime environment conflicts, (3) API pattern differences between old/new approaches, (4) Comprehensive test coverage maintenance, (5) Debugging new library behaviors, (6) Potential rollback needs
**Example**: 30-40 minutes of focused refactoring work (584 + 754 lines) was blocked by runtime library error. Should have been estimated as COMPLEX with compatibility validation phase first.
**Files**: Complete refactoring of two large test files representing comprehensive CRUD and lifecycle testing

## Working Test Pattern Preservation Strategy
**First seen**: 2025-08-28
**Last used**: 2025-08-28
**Times referenced**: 1
**Effectiveness**: 95
**Context**: Maintaining test coverage while exploring new testing approaches
**Solution**: **PRESERVE WORKING PATTERNS**: When existing test infrastructure provides comprehensive coverage (22 tests covering CRUD, authentication, FSRS integration, permissions, edge cases), prioritize stability over adopting new libraries. Benefits of working internal patterns: (1) Proven reliability, (2) Comprehensive coverage achieved, (3) No runtime compatibility issues, (4) Team familiarity, (5) Direct mutation testing capability
**Example**: Convex `_handler` pattern with TestConvexDB provided complete test coverage including authentication simulation, database operations, soft delete testing, and concurrent operations. Should be preserved as primary testing strategy.

## Library Compatibility Validation Before Adoption Pattern
**First seen**: 2025-08-28
**Last used**: 2025-08-28
**Times referenced**: 1
**Effectiveness**: 90
**Context**: Evaluating new libraries for production use, especially testing libraries with complex environment requirements
**Solution**: **VALIDATION-FIRST APPROACH**: Before adopting any new testing library: (1) Create minimal test example to verify basic functionality, (2) Test in target runtime environment (edge-runtime for Convex), (3) Validate with existing dependency versions, (4) Check for peer dependency conflicts, (5) Test library error handling and debugging experience, (6) Compare API ergonomics with existing patterns, (7) Document fallback strategy if library fails
**Example**: convex-test should have been validated with single test file before refactoring 1300+ lines of working tests. Runtime ".glob is not a function" error suggests environment incompatibility that would be caught by minimal validation.
**Files**: Testing validation should be done in isolated environment before major refactoring

## Convex Testing Internal API Pattern Documentation
**First seen**: 2025-08-28
**Last used**: 2025-08-28
**Times referenced**: 2
**Effectiveness**: 85
**Context**: Documenting reliable internal testing patterns for Convex mutations and queries when official libraries are unstable
**Solution**: **INTERNAL API RELIABILITY**: Convex mutations expose testing interface via `_handler` property: `mutationName._handler(ctx, args)`. This pattern enables: (1) Direct mutation testing without mocking, (2) Comprehensive authentication context simulation, (3) Database state verification, (4) Error handling validation, (5) Complex business logic testing. Create TestConvexDB for database simulation and realistic session management.
**Example**: `updateQuestion._handler(testCtx, { questionId, updates, sessionToken })` provides direct access to mutation logic with simulated Convex context. Proven stable across comprehensive test suites covering CRUD operations, permissions, soft deletes, and FSRS integration.

## Business Logic Focused Testing Pattern for Convex CRUD Operations
**First seen**: 2025-08-28
**Last used**: 2025-08-28
**Times referenced**: 1
**Effectiveness**: 95
**Context**: Writing comprehensive unit tests for CRUD mutations without complex mocking infrastructure
**Solution**: **FOCUS ON BUSINESS LOGIC**: Test the expected behavior patterns rather than mocking entire database context. Use `_handler` pattern for direct mutation access. Key areas: (1) Permission enforcement (creator-only patterns), (2) Data integrity preservation (FSRS fields protection), (3) State transitions (soft delete/restore behavior), (4) Edge case handling (invalid IDs, expired sessions), (5) Validation patterns (required fields, format validation)
**Example**: 16 test cases covering updateQuestion, softDeleteQuestion, restoreQuestion with comprehensive permission checks, FSRS field preservation, and soft delete state validation. Tests validate business logic without needing full Convex context simulation.

## Creator-Only Permission Testing Pattern
**First seen**: 2025-08-28
**Last used**: 2025-08-28
**Times referenced**: 1
**Effectiveness**: 90
**Context**: Testing ownership-based permission systems in CRUD operations
**Solution**: **SYSTEMATIC PERMISSION VALIDATION**: Test all permission combinations: (1) Valid owner with active session, (2) Non-owner attempting access, (3) Invalid/expired session tokens, (4) Missing session authentication, (5) Non-existent resource IDs. Pattern: Create test data with specific ownership, attempt operations with different user contexts, verify proper rejection/success based on ownership rules.
**Example**: Questions CRUD operations enforce creator-only access. Tests verify updateQuestion allows owner edits but rejects non-owner attempts, softDeleteQuestion only works for creators, and restoreQuestion maintains ownership validation.

## FSRS Field Preservation Testing Pattern
**First seen**: 2025-08-28
**Last used**: 2025-08-28
**Times referenced**: 1
**Effectiveness**: 88
**Context**: Testing that spaced repetition algorithm fields are protected during CRUD operations
**Solution**: **CRITICAL DATA FIELD PROTECTION**: Verify that spaced repetition fields (nextReview, stability, fsrsDifficulty, elapsedDays, scheduledDays, reps, lapses, state, lastReview) are never modified by general CRUD operations. Pattern: (1) Set up question with FSRS data, (2) Perform CRUD operation (update/soft delete/restore), (3) Verify all FSRS fields remain unchanged, (4) Test both successful operations and error conditions preserve FSRS integrity
**Example**: updateQuestion operations must preserve all 9 FSRS fields during question text/topic updates. Tests verify FSRS algorithm data remains intact across update, soft delete, and restore operations to maintain spaced repetition scheduling integrity.

## Soft Delete State Testing Pattern
**First seen**: 2025-08-28
**Last used**: 2025-08-28
**Times referenced**: 1
**Effectiveness**: 92
**Context**: Testing soft delete and restore functionality with proper state transitions
**Solution**: **STATE TRANSITION VALIDATION**: Test complete soft delete lifecycle: (1) Active state â†’ soft deleted (sets deletedAt timestamp), (2) Soft deleted â†’ restored (clears deletedAt), (3) Data preservation during soft delete (all fields maintained), (4) Permission consistency (only creator can delete/restore), (5) Invalid state transitions (delete already deleted, restore already active)
**Example**: softDeleteQuestion adds deletedAt timestamp while preserving all other data. restoreQuestion clears deletedAt to restore active state. Tests verify state transitions, data integrity, and permission enforcement throughout deletion lifecycle.
