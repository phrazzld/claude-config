# Code Review Checklist

Fast, focused checklist for reviewing code changes. Designed to complete in <5 minutes for typical PRs.

## How to Use This Checklist

- **For PR reviews:** Work through categories, flag issues, suggest improvements
- **For self-review:** Before requesting review, check your own changes
- **For pairing:** Use as discussion guide during pair programming

**Not every item applies to every PR.** Use judgment. Small fixes may skip entire categories.

---

## 1. Purpose & Design

**Does this change solve the right problem in the right way?**

- [ ] Does this change solve the stated problem?
- [ ] Is the approach appropriate for the problem scope?
- [ ] Are there simpler alternatives that were considered?
- [ ] Does this fit with existing architecture patterns?

**Red flags:**
- Over-engineered solution for simple problem
- Doesn't address root cause (treats symptom)
- Introduces new pattern when existing one would work

---

## 2. Code Quality

**Is the code readable, maintainable, and simple?**

- [ ] Are names clear and intention-revealing?
- [ ] Is the code self-documenting (minimal comments needed)?
- [ ] Are functions/modules focused on single responsibility?
- [ ] Is complexity managed (no deep nesting, long functions)?
- [ ] Are magic numbers/strings extracted to constants?

**Examples:**

❌ **Poor naming:**
```typescript
function proc(d: any) { ... }
const x = getUserData()
```

✅ **Clear naming:**
```typescript
function processPayment(data: PaymentData) { ... }
const activeUsers = getUserData()
```

❌ **Deep nesting:**
```typescript
if (user) {
  if (user.isActive) {
    if (user.hasPermission) {
      // deeply nested logic
    }
  }
}
```

✅ **Guard clauses:**
```typescript
if (!user) return
if (!user.isActive) return
if (!user.hasPermission) return
// flat logic
```

**Red flags:**
- Generic names (Manager, Helper, Util, Handler)
- Functions over 50 lines
- Nesting deeper than 3 levels
- Unclear variable purposes

---

## 3. Correctness

**Does the code work correctly under all conditions?**

- [ ] Are edge cases handled (null, empty, boundary values)?
- [ ] Is error handling appropriate and informative?
- [ ] Are async operations handled correctly (race conditions, timeouts)?
- [ ] Are types used correctly (no unsafe casts, `any` abuse)?
- [ ] Does the logic match the requirements?

**Edge cases to check:**
- Empty arrays/strings
- Null/undefined values
- Boundary values (0, -1, MAX_INT)
- Concurrent operations
- Network failures

**Examples:**

❌ **Missing edge case:**
```typescript
function getFirstUser(users: User[]) {
  return users[0].name  // Crashes on empty array
}
```

✅ **Edge case handled:**
```typescript
function getFirstUser(users: User[]) {
  return users[0]?.name ?? 'No users'
}
```

❌ **Type abuse:**
```typescript
const data: any = await fetchData()
const userId = (data as User).id  // Unsafe
```

✅ **Type safety:**
```typescript
const data = await fetchData()
if (!isUser(data)) throw new Error('Invalid user data')
const userId = data.id
```

**Red flags:**
- No null checks
- Ignored promise rejections
- Type assertions without validation
- Assumes happy path only

---

## 4. Security

**Are there security vulnerabilities?**

- [ ] Is user input validated and sanitized?
- [ ] Are secrets/credentials handled securely (no hardcoding)?
- [ ] Is authentication/authorization checked where needed?
- [ ] Are SQL/command injection risks mitigated?

**Common vulnerabilities:**

❌ **SQL injection:**
```typescript
db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`)
```

✅ **Parameterized query:**
```typescript
db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [userId])
```

❌ **Hardcoded secret:**
```typescript
const API_KEY = 'sk_live_abc123...'
```

✅ **Environment variable:**
```typescript
const API_KEY = process.env.API_KEY
if (!API_KEY) throw new Error('API_KEY not configured')
```

❌ **Missing auth check:**
```typescript
async function deleteUser(userId: string) {
  await db.users.delete(userId)
}
```

✅ **Auth check:**
```typescript
async function deleteUser(userId: string, requestingUserId: string) {
  if (!canDeleteUser(requestingUserId, userId)) {
    throw new UnauthorizedError()
  }
  await db.users.delete(userId)
}
```

**Red flags:**
- Direct SQL string concatenation
- Secrets in code
- Missing auth checks on sensitive operations
- Unvalidated redirects or file paths

---

## 5. Performance

**Are there obvious performance issues?**

- [ ] Are there obvious performance issues (N+1 queries, unnecessary loops)?
- [ ] Is data fetching efficient (pagination, caching considered)?
- [ ] Are re-renders/re-computations minimized (React: memo, useMemo)?

**Common issues:**

❌ **N+1 query:**
```typescript
for (const user of users) {
  user.posts = await db.posts.find({ userId: user.id })
}
```

✅ **Batch query:**
```typescript
const userIds = users.map(u => u.id)
const posts = await db.posts.find({ userId: { $in: userIds } })
const postsByUser = groupBy(posts, 'userId')
users.forEach(u => u.posts = postsByUser[u.id] || [])
```

❌ **Unnecessary re-renders:**
```typescript
function UserList({ users }: Props) {
  const sorted = users.sort((a, b) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name))
  // Re-sorts on every render
}
```

✅ **Memoized computation:**
```typescript
function UserList({ users }: Props) {
  const sorted = useMemo(
    () => users.sort((a, b) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name)),
    [users]
  )
}
```

**Red flags:**
- Queries in loops
- Missing indexes on filtered/sorted columns
- Large payloads without pagination
- Expensive computations without memoization

---

## 6. Testing

**Are changes adequately tested?**

- [ ] Are critical paths tested (happy path + key errors)?
- [ ] Do tests verify behavior, not implementation details?
- [ ] Are test names clear about what they verify?

**Good test characteristics:**

✅ **Clear test name:**
```typescript
it('should return 404 when user not found', async () => {
  const response = await request(app).get('/users/999')
  expect(response.status).toBe(404)
})
```

✅ **Tests behavior:**
```typescript
it('should disable submit button while submitting', async () => {
  render(<Form />)
  const button = screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })
  await userEvent.click(button)
  expect(button).toBeDisabled()
})
```

❌ **Tests implementation:**
```typescript
it('should call setState when button clicked', () => {
  const mockSetState = jest.fn()
  // Testing implementation detail, not behavior
})
```

**Red flags:**
- No tests for new feature
- Tests only test happy path
- Tests coupled to implementation
- Unclear what test verifies

---

## 7. Documentation

**Is the change adequately documented?**

- [ ] Are non-obvious decisions explained in comments?
- [ ] Is user-facing documentation updated (README, API docs)?
- [ ] Are breaking changes clearly documented?

**When to comment:**

✅ **Explain "why":**
```typescript
// Use exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming API during outages
const retryDelay = Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000
```

✅ **Document non-obvious behavior:**
```typescript
// Returns null instead of throwing to allow graceful degradation
// when feature flag service is unavailable
function getFeatureFlag(name: string): boolean | null { ... }
```

❌ **Don't explain "what":**
```typescript
// Increment counter by 1
counter += 1
```

**Documentation updates needed:**
- New public API → Update API docs
- Changed behavior → Update README
- Breaking change → Update CHANGELOG, migration guide
- New environment variable → Update deployment docs

**Red flags:**
- Breaking change without migration guide
- New feature without usage examples
- Complex algorithm without explanation
- Changed behavior without updating docs

- Breaking changes without migration path
- Incorrect logic on critical path

### Request Changes (Strong Suggestion)
- Poor naming (hard to understand)
- Missing error handling
- No tests for new behavior
- Performance issues (N+1, obvious bottlenecks)

### Suggest Improvements (Nice to Have)
- Could be simpler
- Could have better names
- Could use helper function
- Could add more tests

### Approve (Minor or Nitpick)
- Style preferences
- Alternative approaches (both work)
- Optional refactoring opportunities

## Philosophy

**Good code review is:**
- **Fast:** <5 minutes for typical PR
- **Focused:** Critical issues first, nitpicks last
- **Constructive:** Suggest improvements, don't just criticize
- **Collaborative:** Discussion, not dictation

**Good code review is NOT:**
- Gatekeeping or showing off knowledge
- Rewriting in your preferred style
- Blocking on personal preferences
- Testing (that's CI's job)

**Remember:** You're reviewing to help ship better code, not perfect code.
