# Documentation Standards

Universal principles for effective documentation. Language-agnostic—focus on what and when to document, not syntax.

## Core Principle

**Good code documents itself. Comments explain what code cannot.**

Prefer clear names and simple structure over comments. Write comments for reasoning, not restating.

---

## Comments vs Code

### When to Comment

**ALWAYS comment:**
- **Why** (reasoning, trade-offs, decisions)
  - "Use exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming API during outages"
  - "Chose algorithm X over Y because of O(n) vs O(n²) performance"

- **Non-obvious decisions**
  - "Cache invalidation: 5 minutes chosen to balance freshness vs load"
  - "Intentionally skipping validation here—already validated upstream"

- **Workarounds**
  - "Temporary fix for bug in library X version 1.2.3"
  - "Work around browser quirk in Safari < 15"

- **Gotchas and constraints**
  - "Must call init() before use or will throw"
  - "Not thread-safe—caller must synchronize"
  - "Order matters: must authenticate before making requests"

**SOMETIMES comment:**
- **Complex algorithms** (high-level what, not line-by-line)
  - "Binary search to find insertion point in sorted array"
  - "Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path"

- **Business rules**
  - "Tax calculation per regulation ABC-123 effective Jan 2024"
  - "Discount tiers: 10% for >100 items, 20% for >500"

**RARELY comment:**
- **What** (code should be self-documenting)
  - If you need to explain what, improve naming/structure first

**NEVER comment:**
- Obvious code
  - Bad: `i++  // Increment i`
- Commented-out code (delete it—it's in git)
- Lies (outdated comments worse than no comments)

### "Why Not What" Principle

✅ **Good comments** (explain reasoning):
```
// Use exponential backoff to prevent thundering herd
retryDelay = baseDelay * Math.pow(2, attempt)

// Cache for performance—database query is expensive
const cachedResult = cache.get(key)
```

❌ **Bad comments** (restate code):
```
// Set retry delay to base delay times 2 to the power of attempt
retryDelay = baseDelay * Math.pow(2, attempt)

// Get cached result from cache
const cachedResult = cache.get(key)
```

### Exceptions to "Why Not What"

**Complex algorithms benefit from high-level "what":**
```
// Find longest common subsequence using dynamic programming
// Returns length and the subsequence itself
function longestCommonSubsequence(s1, s2)
```

**Public API contracts (inputs, outputs, errors):**
```
// Authenticates user with email and password
// Returns: User object on success
// Throws: AuthError if credentials invalid
// Throws: NetworkError if connection fails
function authenticate(email, password)
```

### Comment Density: Minimal

**Prefer over comments:**
1. Better names
2. Simpler code structure
3. Extracted functions (self-documenting)
4. Smaller modules

**Rule:** If you need a comment to explain what code does, refactor first.

**Comments should add information code cannot express.**

## README and Technical Docs

### README.md Structure

**Every project needs a README.**

**Minimal required sections:**

1. **What** (one sentence)
   - Clear, concise description
   - "Task management CLI tool for developers"

2. **Why** (problem it solves)
   - "Existing task managers don't integrate with git/editors"

3. **Quick Start** (fastest path to running)
   - Installation
   - Basic usage example
   - This comes FIRST after description

4. **Setup** (getting started)
   - Prerequisites
   - Installation steps
   - Configuration

**Optional sections** (add as needed):
- Examples (common use cases)
- Features (capabilities)
- Documentation (link to detailed docs)
- Contributing (how to help)
- License
- Troubleshooting (common issues)

### README Anti-Patterns

❌ **Novel-length README**
- Save detailed docs for separate files
- README should get you started, not cover everything

❌ **Out-of-date examples**
- Worse than no examples
- Update with breaking changes or delete

❌ **No quick start**
- Forcing users to read entire doc before trying it
- Put fastest path to success up front

❌ **Installation that doesn't work**
- Test your own installation instructions
- What works on your machine ≠ what works elsewhere

### Other Documentation Types

**ADRs (Architecture Decision Records):**
- **What:** Record of architectural decisions
- **When:** Making significant architectural choices
- **Format:** Context, Decision, Consequences
- **Example:** "Why we chose database X over Y"

**ARCHITECTURE.md:**
- **What:** High-level system design
- **When:** System complex enough to need overview
- **Content:** Components, relationships, data flow
- **Keep:** Updated with major changes

**CONTRIBUTING.md:**
- **What:** How to contribute to project
- **When:** Accepting external contributors (open source, team projects)
- **Content:** Setup, workflow, standards, review process

**CHANGELOG.md:**
- **What:** What changed between versions
- **When:** Project has releases/versions
- **Format:** Chronological, grouped by version
- **Include:** Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed

**API Documentation:**
- **What:** Public API reference
- **When:** Building libraries for others
- **Best:** Generated from code comments (stays in sync)
- **Avoid:** Manually maintained separate docs (get stale)

### When to Create Each Document

- **README:** ALWAYS (every project)
- **ADRs:** Significant architectural decisions
- **ARCHITECTURE.md:** Complex system needing diagram
- **CONTRIBUTING.md:** Accepting external contributions
- **CHANGELOG:** Versioned releases
- **API docs:** Libraries meant for other developers

## Documentation Maintenance

### When to Update Docs

**ALWAYS update:**
- Breaking changes (users depend on documented behavior)
- New features (users need to discover them)
- Deprecated features (warn before removal)

**USUALLY update:**
- Bug fixes that change behavior
- New configuration options
- Performance improvements (if significant)

**RARELY update:**
- Internal refactors (implementation changes)
- Bug fixes that don't change behavior
- Code cleanup

### Stale Docs Are Worse Than No Docs

**Users trust documentation.**

Wrong documentation is worse than no documentation—it wastes time and builds mistrust.

**If you can't maintain docs:**
- Delete them (better than lying)
- Or clearly mark as outdated
- Or link to code as source of truth

### Documentation Debt

**When to defer documentation:**
- Experimental features (still exploring)
- Internal tools (team already knows)
- Prototypes (may be discarded)

**When documentation debt becomes unacceptable:**
- Feature shipping to users
- Onboarding new team members
- Open sourcing project

## Diagrams

### When to Use Diagrams

✅ **Use diagrams when they clarify:**
- System architecture (components, relationships)
- Data flow (how data moves through system)
- State machines (states and transitions)
- Complex interactions (sequence diagrams)

❌ **Don't use diagrams:**
- As decoration (diagrams should clarify, not prettify)
- For simple systems (often code is clearer)
- Without maintaining them (stale diagrams mislead)

### Diagram Principles

**Keep simple:**
- Complex diagrams become stale
- Focus on high-level relationships
- Details belong in code

**Text-based preferred:**
- Version control friendly
- Easy to update
- Tools: Any text-based diagram format your team prefers

**Maintain or delete:**
- Update diagrams with system changes
- Or delete outdated diagrams (don't let them lie)

## Quick Reference

### Documentation Checklist

**Before writing comment:**
- [ ] Can I make code clearer instead?
- [ ] Am I explaining "why" or just "what"?
- [ ] Would future me find this helpful?
- [ ] Is this non-obvious or a gotcha?

**Before shipping feature:**
- [ ] README updated (if user-facing)?
- [ ] Breaking changes documented?
- [ ] Examples still work?
- [ ] Quick start still accurate?

**Starting new project:**
- [ ] README with What, Why, Quick Start, Setup
- [ ] License (if sharing)
- [ ] .gitignore (keep docs, ignore build artifacts)

**When making architectural decision:**
- [ ] Should this be an ADR?
- [ ] Will team need context in 6 months?
- [ ] Is this a significant departure from current approach?

## Philosophy

**"Code tells you how. Comments tell you why."**

The best documentation is code that doesn't need documentation. But when code can't express intent, comments bridge the gap.

**Documentation is for humans:**
- Future you (6 months from now)
- Team members (new and experienced)
- Users (trying to use your code)

**Documentation is not:**
- A substitute for clear code
- A place to explain bad design
- Something to write and forget

**Remember:** Undocumented code is hard to use. Documented wrong code is harder.
