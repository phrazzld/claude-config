# /crypto-gains

Calculate capital gains with IRS-compliant rules.

## Steps

1. Load lots from `normalized/cost-basis.json` and transactions from `normalized/transactions.json`.
2. Build sell list and allocate FIFO lots per asset.
3. Classify each gain as short-term or long-term by holding period.
4. Detect wash sales within 30 days for securities. Mark crypto as not applicable per current policy.
5. Write gains to `normalized/capital-gains.json` and updated lots to `normalized/cost-basis-updated.json`.
6. Generate Form 8949 outputs and summaries.

## Examples

```bash
# Build FIFO gains and updated lots
pnpm gains
```

```bash
# Generate Form 8949 and tax summaries
pnpm report
```
