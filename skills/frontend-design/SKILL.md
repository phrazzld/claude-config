This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

**YOU TEND TO CONVERGE TOWARD GENERIC, "ON DISTRIBUTION" OUTPUTS.** In frontend design, this creates what users call the "AI slop" aesthetic. Avoid this: make creative, distinctive frontends that surprise and delight.

Focus on:
- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
  - **CRITICAL**: You still tend to converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, Satoshi, Inter Variable) across generations. **AVOID THIS**—it is critical that you think outside the box! Each project deserves its own font personality.

- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes. Draw from IDE themes and cultural aesthetics for inspiration.
  - **Vary your palette approach**: One project might be high-contrast monochrome, another soft pastels, another bold neons. Don't default to the same "safe" palettes.

- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.

- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.

- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Layer CSS gradients, use geometric patterns, or add contextual effects that match the overall aesthetic. Specific techniques:
  - **Gradient meshes**: Multi-color gradients for dynamic atmosphere
  - **Noise textures**: SVG or CSS noise for analog warmth
  - **Geometric patterns**: Subtle repeating shapes or grids
  - **Layered transparencies**: Overlapping elements with opacity
  - **Dramatic shadows**: Deep shadows with color tints
  - **Decorative borders**: Custom border treatments with personality
  - **Custom cursors**: Brand-specific cursor design
  - **Grain overlays**: Film grain for texture and depth

**NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics:**
- ❌ Overused font families: Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts, Space Grotesk (AI favorite)
- ❌ Cliched color schemes: particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds
- ❌ Predictable layouts: centered max-width containers on every page
- ❌ Cookie-cutter design: lacks context-specific character

**CRITICAL VARIATION MANDATE:**
Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. **No design should be the same.** Vary between:
- Light and dark themes (don't always default to light)
- Different font pairings (avoid your go-to favorites)
- Different aesthetics (editorial, brutalist, luxury, playful, technical, organic)
- Different color approaches (monochrome, bold, pastel, neon, earth tones)

**NEVER converge on common choices across generations.** Each project is unique—treat it that way.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.

Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.
