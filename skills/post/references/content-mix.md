# Content Mix Guidelines

## The 30/70 Rule

For sustainable social media presence:
- **30% Product Content**: Updates, features, launches
- **70% Valuable Content**: Tips, insights, community engagement

## Why This Ratio?

Following an account that only talks about itself is exhausting.
People follow for value, not advertising.

The 70% valuable content:
- Builds trust and authority
- Attracts new followers organically
- Creates engagement (comments, shares)
- Makes the 30% product content more effective

## Product Content (30%)

### Good product posts:
- New feature announcements
- Milestone celebrations ("1000 users!")
- Bug fixes that users care about
- Behind-the-scenes building
- User testimonials/stories

### Avoid:
- Pure promotional ("Buy now!")
- Too frequent ("another update...")
- No context ("Feature X is live")

## Valuable Content (70%)

### Types of valuable content:

**Educational**
- How-to tips related to your domain
- Common mistakes and how to avoid them
- Best practices and techniques

**Curated**
- Interesting articles/resources
- Industry news (with your take)
- Tool recommendations

**Engagement**
- Questions for the community
- Polls and surveys
- Celebrating others' wins

**Entertainment**
- Relatable observations
- Domain-specific humor
- Memes (if on-brand)

## Content Calendar Suggestion

Weekly rhythm for 2-3 posts/week:

| Day | Type | Example |
|-----|------|---------|
| Monday | Valuable | Tip or educational content |
| Wednesday | Product | Feature update or building in public |
| Friday | Engagement | Question or community celebration |

## Hashtag Strategy

**Primary (every post)**: 2-3 domain hashtags
- #fitness #strengthtraining

**Product (product posts only)**: 1-2 branded hashtags
- #volumeapp

**Trending (occasionally)**: Join relevant conversations
- #buildinpublic #indiedev

## Voice Consistency

Match every post to brand profile:
- Tone (casual, professional, playful)
- Personality traits
- Things to avoid

Even valuable content should sound like your brand.

## Metrics to Watch

Good signs:
- Engagement rate increasing
- Follower growth (organic)
- Saves and shares
- DMs asking about product

Warning signs:
- Unfollows after product posts
- Low engagement on everything
- Comments only from bots
- No growth despite posting

If product posts consistently underperform, ratio might need adjusting.
