# /growth-sprint

Weekly growth sprint ritual. Pick one product and push it.

## Philosophy

Marketing as a loop, not a vibe: Signal → Offer → Distribution → Measurement → Iterate

## The Sprint Checklist

Include these sections with checkboxes:

### Content (3 posts, same idea, different wrapper)
- [ ] Twitter/X: hot take + demo link
- [ ] Reddit: problem-first + "here's what I built"
- [ ] Indie Hackers / HN: builder log + numbers/learning

### Distribution (1 submission)
- [ ] Product Hunt (when ready)
- [ ] Hacker News (Show HN)
- [ ] Relevant subreddit
- [ ] Niche directory/list

### Outreach (10 DMs)
- [ ] Not "buy my thing"
- [ ] "I built X for Y — mind telling me if this solves your problem? 2 questions."

### Measure
- [ ] Visits: ___
- [ ] Signups: ___
- [ ] Activations: ___
- [ ] Paid: ___

## Process

1. Ask which product to focus on this week
2. Check for existing brand-profile.yaml (if not exists, suggest /brand-builder)
3. Walk through each checklist section interactively
4. For content: generate drafts using brand profile if available
5. For distribution: prepare templates (NOT auto-post to Reddit/HN - ban risk)
6. For outreach: help identify 10 DM targets
7. Log results to growth-sprint-log.md (append to existing or create)
8. Summarize and set next week's focus
