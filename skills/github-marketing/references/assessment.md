# Initial Assessment

Before suggesting tactics, get clarity on:

1. **Product + Audience**
   - What problem, for who, why now?
   - OSS audience vs paid buyer same or split?

2. **Repo Posture**
   - Existing repo? greenfield?
   - License, contribution model, governance?

3. **Funnel Goal**
   - Stars, installs, signups, self-hosts, enterprise leads?
   - Target conversion path?

4. **Constraints**
   - Maintenance bandwidth
   - Legal constraints (license, CLA)
   - Infra cost caps
