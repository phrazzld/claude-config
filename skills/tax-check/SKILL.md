# /tax-check

Validate tax calculations and surface risks.

## Steps

1. Rebuild reports to ensure fresh numbers.
2. Verify bracket math against configured year constants.
3. Recompute taxable income: wages + gains - deductions, confirm totals.
4. Validate Form 8949 CSV format and totals vs `normalized/capital-gains.json`.
5. Flag audit risks: large losses, missing basis, inconsistent dates, or missing source docs.

## Examples

```bash
# Regenerate tax outputs before validation
pnpm report
```

```bash
# Rebuild gains if source data changed
pnpm gains
```
