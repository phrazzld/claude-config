- [Outcome 1]
- [Outcome 2]
- [Outcome 3]

## Key Optimization (Optional)

**[Performance insight or important constraint]**

[Explain why this optimization matters and what improvement it provides. Include specific metrics if relevant (e.g., "reduces time from X to Y" or "scales O(N) → O(1)")]

## Template Usage Notes

**Delete this section when creating actual command!**

**Length targets:**
- **Simple commands**: 80-120 lines
- **Medium complexity**: 120-180 lines
- **Complex workflows**: 180-300 lines
- **Never exceed**: 400 lines

**Key principles:**
- Describe WHAT and WHY, not exact HOW
- Include bash examples only for non-obvious operations
- Emphasize parallelization where applicable
- Make steps conditional when appropriate ("if needed")
- Trust Claude to choose optimal approaches

**Structure flexibility:**
- Not all sections are required
- Adapt structure to command needs
- Maintain natural flow over rigid formatting
- Prioritize clarity over template compliance

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Numbered phases (Phase 1, 1.1, 1.2, 2, 2.5...)
- Exact bash command sequences (unless critical)
- Verbose documentation templates to fill in
- Mandatory sequential steps that could be conditional
- Excessive use case examples (1-2 is ideal)
