Execute the next available task from TODO.md.

# EXECUTE

Grab next task from TODO.md ‚Üí Think about approach ‚Üí Do the work ‚Üí Commit atomically ‚Üí Mark complete

## PROCESS

1. **Find next task**: Look for first `[~]` (in-progress) or `[ ]` (not started) task in TODO.md
2. **Mark in-progress**: Update `[ ]` to `[~]`
3. **Think very hard before acting**:
   - Think very hard
   - Consider the approach and plan implementation
   - Look for existing patterns in the codebase to follow
   - Identify relevant files and implementation approach
   - **üéØ SIMPLICITY VALIDATION**: Ask "What's the simplest solution that completely solves this?"
     - Reject clever solutions in favor of boring, obvious ones
     - If you can't explain it to a junior dev, it's too complex
     - Prefer explicit over implicit behavior
4. **Do the work**: Implement what the task describes
   - **üéØ SIMPLICITY DURING IMPLEMENTATION**:
     - Choose boring technology over exciting alternatives
     - Write code that reads like documentation
     - Make the happy path obvious
     - Keep cyclomatic complexity low
   - **üéØ MAINTAINABILITY PRINCIPLE**:
     - Write for the next developer (who might be you in 6 months)
     - Name things based on what they do, not how they work
     - Leave breadcrumbs: clear function signatures, explicit types
     - Optimize for readability over cleverness
     - Future changes should be obvious, not archaeological digs
   - **üéØ FIX BROKEN WINDOWS**:
     - See a problem? Fix it now. Technical debt compounds.
     - Notice a typo? Fix it. Poor naming? Rename it.
     - Find commented code? Delete it. Git remembers.
     - Spot inconsistent formatting? Correct it immediately.
     - Quality erosion starts with "I'll fix it later"
5. **COMMIT ATOMICALLY**:
   - Every completed task gets a commit. No exceptions.
   - Stage relevant changes: `git add -p` or `git add [files]`
   - Write semantic commit message: `git commit -m "type: concise description"`
   - Types: `feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore`
6. **Mark complete**: Update `[~]` to `[x]` when done

## THE CARMACK RULE

*"A task without a commit is a task not done."*

Every completed task must result in an atomic commit. This isn't optional - it's fundamental to maintaining a clean, traceable history. If you can't commit it, the task isn't actually complete.

## WORK LOG

For complex tasks or when discovering important context, add a work log entry directly under the task in TODO.md:

```markdown
- [~] Implement user authentication
  ```
  Work Log:
  - Found existing auth pattern in services/auth.ts
  - Need to follow JWT token approach from api/middleware
  - Database schema already has user table, just needs session table
  - Blocked by: need to clarify token expiry requirements
  ```
```

This work log serves as:
- Scratchpad for discoveries and context
- Record of decisions made
- Place to note blockers or questions
- Memory for if task is resumed later


## üéØ SIMPLICITY VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before implementing any solution, validate against these simplicity criteria:

### The Simplicity Test
- **Can I explain this solution in one sentence?** If not, it's too complex.
- **Would a junior developer understand this immediately?** If not, simplify.
- **Am I solving problems that don't exist yet?** YAGNI - You Aren't Gonna Need It.
- **Is this the "boring" solution?** Boring is reliable. Clever is suspicious.

### Code Simplicity Metrics
- **Line count**: Can this be done in fewer lines without sacrificing clarity?
- **Cyclomatic complexity**: Are there too many decision points?
- **Dependencies**: Am I adding complexity through external dependencies?
- **Abstraction layers**: Am I creating unnecessary indirection?

### The Simplicity Reflex
When you find yourself:
- Writing a factory for a single type ‚Üí **Stop**, use direct instantiation
- Creating an interface with one implementation ‚Üí **Stop**, wait for the second use case
- Building a generic solution for a specific problem ‚Üí **Stop**, solve the specific problem
- Adding configuration for values that never change ‚Üí **Stop**, use constants

## üéØ MAINTAINABILITY GUIDELINES

Code is read 100x more than it's written. Optimize for the reader, not the writer.

### The Future Developer Test
Ask yourself: *"If I had to modify this code in 6 months, what would I curse myself for?"*

### Maintainability Principles
- **Explicit Intent**: Code should announce what it does, not make you deduce it
- **Local Reasoning**: Understanding a function shouldn't require understanding the entire system
- **Obvious Extension Points**: Where changes will happen should be clear
- **Consistent Patterns**: Do similar things in similar ways

### Naming for Maintainability
```
‚ùå processData()      ‚Üí ‚úÖ validateAndNormalizeUserInput()
‚ùå flag               ‚Üí ‚úÖ isEmailVerified
‚ùå helper()           ‚Üí ‚úÖ formatDateForDisplay()
‚ùå doStuff()          ‚Üí ‚úÖ syncInventoryWithWarehouse()
```

### Code Organization for Future Changes
- **Group by feature**, not by file type (components/UserProfile not components/buttons)
- **Colocate related code** (keep the test next to the implementation)
- **Make dependencies explicit** (imports at the top, clear interfaces)
- **Leave escape hatches** (extension points for likely changes)

## üéØ FIX BROKEN WINDOWS PROTOCOL

*"One broken window, left unrepaired, leads to more broken windows."* - The Broken Windows Theory

### Automatic Quality Detection During Execution
While implementing any task, actively scan for and immediately fix:

### Code Smells to Fix On Sight
- **Dead Code**: Commented-out blocks, unreachable code, unused imports
- **Poor Naming**: Single letters (except loop counters), abbreviations, misleading names
- **Magic Numbers**: Hardcoded values that should be constants
- **Duplicate Code**: Copy-paste that should be extracted
- **Long Functions**: If it doesn't fit on a screen, break it up
- **Deep Nesting**: More than 3 levels? Time to refactor

### The Fix-It-Now Rule
```
if (you_see_it && you_can_fix_it_in_under_2_minutes) {
    fix_it_now();  // Don't defer, don't document, just fix
}
```

### Quality Erosion Indicators
Watch for these signs that windows are breaking:
- TODO comments older than the current sprint
- Inconsistent code style in the same file
- Test files with skipped/commented tests
- Error handling with empty catch blocks
- Console.logs in production code paths

### The Boy Scout Rule
*"Leave the code better than you found it"* - Even if you didn't break it

When working in a file:
1. Fix formatting inconsistencies
2. Update outdated comments
3. Rename unclear variables you encounter
4. Extract magic numbers to constants
5. Remove unnecessary complexity

## NOTES

- Always think through the approach before diving into implementation
- If task includes context or detailed steps, follow them
- If blocked, mark as `[!]` with explanation in work log and move to next task
- Only preserve work logs that contain valuable context for future reference
- **ALWAYS commit changes after task completion** - no exceptions
- **ALWAYS validate simplicity** - complexity is the enemy of reliability
