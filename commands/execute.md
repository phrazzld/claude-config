Execute the next task directly.

# EXECUTE

Grab next task ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí Mark complete

## Your Mission

Execute the next available task in TODO.md. The decision to work on this task has already been made during planning. Your job: carry it out skillfully.

## Process

**1. Find next task**: Read TODO.md, locate first `[~]` (in-progress) or `[ ]` (pending)

Batch tiny tasks (typo fix, rename, import): Execute consecutively, one commit.
Single substantial task: Execute it.

**2. Is task specific enough?**

Ask only: **"Do I know exactly what to do?"**

‚úÖ Specific enough if task has:
- File locations OR clear scope
- Approach OR pattern to follow
- Success criteria

‚úÖ YES ‚Üí Proceed to step 3
üîç NO ‚Üí Run /flesh to make it specific, then proceed to step 3

**3. Mark in-progress**: Update `[ ]` ‚Üí `[~]`

**4. Implement**

Write the code. Follow existing patterns. Keep it simple.

**Apply principles while coding**:
- **Simplicity**: Prefer boring over clever. Aim for one-sentence explanations.
- **Maintainability**: Choose names that reveal purpose. Document "why" over "what".
- **Explicitness**: Make dependencies visible in signatures. Make side effects obvious from names.
- **Strategic**: Improve design 10-20% while implementing.

**Check implementation quality**:
- Deep module? (Simple interface hiding powerful implementation)
- Information hiding intact? (Changing internals preserves caller code)
- Minimal complexity? (Few dependencies, clear behavior)
- Red flags absent? (Generic names, pass-through methods, temporal decomposition)

**5. Commit atomically**

Every completed task ‚Üí atomic commit with clear message.
Types: feat|fix|docs|refactor|test|chore

**6. Mark complete**: Update `[~]` ‚Üí `[x]`

**7. Continue or stop**: Proceed to next task when appropriate, or report completion.

## Execute Regardless Of

**Execute when task is specific, regardless of:**
- Task complexity (simple or complex)
- Time estimates (15 minutes or 3 hours)
- Session duration (first task or tenth task)
- Implementation challenge (straightforward or intricate)
- Task scope (focused or comprehensive)

**These concerns were addressed upstream**:
- Complexity ‚Üí Handled in /plan (appropriate breakdown)
- Risk ‚Üí Handled in /flesh (clear approach)
- Size ‚Üí Handled in /plan (proper scoping)

**Valid reasons to pause**:
- ‚úÖ Task blocked by missing dependency requiring user input
- ‚úÖ Environment broken (build fails, tests unavailable, fundamental tool failure)
- ‚úÖ Task remains unclear even after /flesh
- ‚úÖ User explicitly requests pause

## The Contract

By the time you run /execute, the decision to do this work **has been made**. That decision happened during:
- `/plan` - Breaking work into appropriate tasks
- `/flesh` - Understanding scope and approach
- User running `/execute` - Choosing to proceed

**Your responsibility**: Carry out that decision skillfully.

**Your focus**: How to implement (quality, simplicity, maintainability), rather than whether to implement.

## Handling Complex Tasks

**Ineffective approach**: Refuse to execute due to perceived complexity.

**Effective approach**:
1. Task genuinely unclear ‚Üí Run /flesh to clarify
2. Task clear but substantial ‚Üí Execute it (this is the job)
3. Discover task merits splitting ‚Üí Add work log noting this for future planning

**Key insight**: Complex tasks are normal in software engineering. Your role: handle them capably.

## Work Logs

For substantial tasks, document discoveries as you go:

```markdown
- [~] Implement user authentication
  ```
  Work Log:
  - Found auth pattern in services/auth.ts
  - Using JWT approach from api/middleware
  - Preserved existing session handling
  ```
```

Work logs capture discoveries, decisions, learnings for continuity.

## The Carmack Rule

**"A task without a commit is a task that's still pending."**

Every completed task results in an atomic commit. This is the definition of "done".

**Remember**: Execute is tactical. Strategic thinking happens upstream in plan/flesh. Your job: implement with quality, commit changes, mark complete. Repeat for next task.
