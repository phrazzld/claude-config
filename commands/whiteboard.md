Generate creative technical brainstorming for backlog items, exploring multiple approaches from conventional to innovative solutions.

# WHITEBOARD

## GOAL
Generate creative technical brainstorming for items in @BACKLOG.md, exploring multiple approaches from conventional to innovative "cut the Gordian knot" solutions.

## 1. Select Backlog Item
- Read @BACKLOG.md to understand available items for brainstorming
- Select one or more related items that would benefit from creative exploration
- Consider items marked as complex, blocked, or needing architecture decisions

## 2. Generate Ideas
- **Leyline Pre-Processing**: Gather creative problem-solving context:
  - Query tenets that encourage innovation and alternative approaches
  - Identify bindings that provide architectural flexibility patterns
  - Internalize principles for evaluating solution trade-offs and complexity
- Think very hard about creative technical brainstorming by exploring the full solution spectrum:
  - **Deep problem analysis**: Clarify the core problem beyond literal description, identify essential vs accidental complexity, challenge unstated assumptions
  - **Solution spectrum exploration**: Generate comprehensive range of solutions including:
    - Conventional approaches with standard patterns
    - Incremental improvements to existing patterns
    - Alternative paradigms or architectural styles
    - Innovative simplifications that "cut the Gordian knot"
    - Blue sky ideas with breakthrough potential
  - **For each approach**, provide concept summary, implementation outline, key decisions, unique advantages, and honest drawbacks
  - **Comparative analysis**: Create complexity vs value matrix, analyze tradeoffs across development effort, performance, maintainability, testing, security
  - **Opinionated recommendation**: Select approach that best balances requirements, philosophy alignment, minimal complexity, extensibility, and maximum value
- Focus on intellectual curiosity and creative exploration of technical potential
- Ensure ideas range from safe/conventional to innovative/risky options

## 3. Update @BACKLOG.md
- Append brainstorming results to @BACKLOG.md as sub-items under the original entry
- Format as nested items with solution approaches:
  ```markdown
  - [Original backlog item]
    - Approach A: [Conventional solution with details]
    - Approach B: [Alternative paradigm with tradeoffs]
    - Approach C: [Innovative simplification]
    - Recommended: [Approach X because...]
  ```
- Include complexity estimates and key decision points for each approach
