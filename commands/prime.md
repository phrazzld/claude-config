Load context. Understand everything. Write nothing.

# PRIME

Use ultrathink to deeply analyze the project state before any action.

## The Readiness Principle

*"Measure twice, cut once."* - Every Carpenter Ever

Gather intelligence first. Execute with confidence later.

## 1. Project State Analysis
- Check git status and recent commits (last 10)
- Identify current branch vs main/master
- Note uncommitted changes and their impact
- Detect project type and tech stack

## 2. Task Intelligence
- Read TODO.md for immediate work items
- Check BACKLOG.md existence and contents
- Assess task complexity and dependencies
- Identify potential blockers early

## 3. Contextual Research
- Web search for best practices on identified technologies
- Context7 MCP for relevant documentation
- Review ./docs/leyline/ for project philosophy
- Check CLAUDE.md for custom instructions

## 4. Pattern Discovery
- Grep codebase for conventions and patterns
- Identify test framework and approach
- Find build/lint/format commands in package.json or similar
- Note architectural decisions and constraints

## 5. Output Readiness Report

Provide brief, actionable summary:
- **Current Context**: Branch, recent changes, work focus
- **Next Tasks**: Immediate actionable items from TODO
- **Key Patterns**: Conventions to follow
- **Blockers**: Any identified impediments
- **Ready For**: Recommended next command (execute/plan/debug)

Remember: **Context is king. Understanding prevents mistakes.**
