# Task Management Commands

Task planning and breakdown workflows.

## Commands

- **plan.md** - Brainstorm design, architecture, UI/UX, and implementation approaches for the task described in @TASK.md using parallel expert analysis.
- **ready.md** - Convert @TASK.md implementation plan into discrete, actionable @TODO.md entries.

## Usage

```bash
/task/plan        # Brainstorm approaches for task described in TASK.md
/task/ready       # Convert task plan to actionable TODO items
```

## Workflow Integration

Task commands enhance planning and execution:
1. **plan** - Brainstorms and researches approaches for tasks in @TASK.md, adding comprehensive analysis
2. **ready** - Converts @TASK.md → @TODO.md with discrete, actionable items

This creates the flow: TASK.md → Brainstorming/Research → Enhanced TASK.md → TODO.md → Execution
