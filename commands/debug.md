Find bugs by thinking, not guessing.

# DEBUG

Channel Kernighan: "The most effective debugging tool is still careful thought, coupled with judiciously placed print statements."

## The Kernighan Principle

"Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it."

Write simple code. You'll thank yourself later.

## Understand the Problem

**Evidence Gathering** - Accept any format:
- **ISSUE.md**: Structured issue description (optional)
- **Inline description**: User describes issue conversationally
- **Screenshots**: User pastes images showing visual issues
- **Logs/Errors**: User pastes console output, stack traces
- **Video**: User references screen recordings
- **Multiple sources**: Combine any/all of above

**Work with whatever evidence is provided** - flexible input formats supported.

**Key questions**:
- What changed recently? (90% of bugs are in new code)
- Can you reproduce it reliably?
- What's the simplest failing case?
- What's the expected vs actual behavior?

## Analyze Evidence

**For screenshots/visual evidence**:
- What UI state is shown?
- What elements are missing or incorrect?
- Console errors visible in dev tools?
- Network failures in network tab?

**For logs/stack traces**:
- What's the error message (exact text)?
- Where does the stack trace point? (file:line)
- What was the triggering action?
- What values were involved?

**For descriptions**:
- Clarify ambiguities: ask specific questions
- Capture reproduction steps precisely
- Understand expected vs actual behavior
- Note any workarounds user discovered

**Synthesize**: Combine all evidence into clear problem statement.

## Form a Hypothesis

**Before touching code**, think through:
- What do you think is broken?
- Why do you think that?
- How will you prove it?
- What if you're wrong?

**Make the system visible** through instrumentation:
- Add strategic logging at key decision points
- Instrument data flow through the system
- Capture state at critical transitions
- Log inputs/outputs of failing functions
- Use structured logging for searchability

## Document Explicitly

Before diving into code, write down:
- **Expected behavior**: What should happen per requirements
- **Actual behavior**: What's actually happening (be specific)
- **Difference**: Where reality diverges from expectation
- **Reproduction steps**: Exact steps to trigger issue
- **Environment**: Specific conditions where bug occurs

Write your hypothesis before testing it. Document evidence supporting or refuting it. Keep a log of what you tried and learned.

## Systematic Investigation

**Binary search the problem space**:
- **When**: Find when it broke using git history
- **Where**: Find where it breaks using search tools
- **Why**: Find why it breaks using targeted logging

**Check usual suspects**:
1. Off-by-one: boundaries, loops, array indices
2. Null/undefined: missing checks, race conditions
3. State mutations: shared state, side effects
4. Async issues: race conditions, promise chains
5. Type mismatches: string vs number, implicit conversions

## Fix With Simplicity

**Choose the simplest fix that solves the problem completely**. Focus bug fixes specifically on the bug. Save refactoring and optimization for separate tasksâ€”this keeps fixes isolated and testable.

- Fix with minimal code change
- Prefer straightforward fixes over clever workarounds
- Keep fixes concrete rather than abstract
- Stay focused on the specific problem
- Address unrelated issues in separate commits

**Can you explain the fix in one sentence?** Aim for this level of clarity.

## Root Cause Documentation

Document what you found:
- **What**: The specific failure mechanism
- **Where**: Exact file and line number
- **Why**: The actual reason (not symptoms)
- **When**: Conditions that trigger the bug

Add a test that captures this specific bug. Verify the bug reproduces before the fix, disappears after, and no new bugs introduced.

## Post-Mortem

Ask yourself:
- Why didn't tests catch this?
- What similar bugs might exist?
- How can we prevent this class of bugs?
- Is the fix simpler than the bug?

## Three Laws of Debugging

1. **Start with your code** (most bugs originate here)
2. **Check your assumptions** (bugs often hide in unexpected places)
3. **Read the complete error message** (every word matters)

Remember: **The best debugger is a fresh pair of eyes and a good night's sleep.**
