# Portfolio Configuration
# Central registry of all projects for cross-product analytics and monitoring

# Single PostHog project for all apps (filter by $host property)
posthog_project_id: "${POSTHOG_PROJECT_ID}"

# All products send to one PostHog project
# Query pattern: Events where $host = "domain.com"
# Benefits: Single API key, cross-product analytics, simpler quota management

projects:
  # - name: volume
  #   domain: volume.fitness
  #   description: Fitness tracking app
  #   sentry_project: volume
  #   stripe_account: acct_xxx
  #   active: true

  # - name: heartbeat
  #   domain: heartbeat.app
  #   description: Health monitoring
  #   sentry_project: heartbeat
  #   stripe_account: acct_xxx
  #   active: true

# Monitoring queries (via PostHog MCP):
# - "Show traffic for volume.fitness this week" → filters by $host
# - "Compare signup rates across all products" → groups by $host
# - "Which product has highest activation rate?" → aggregates by $host

# Standard events tracked across all projects:
# - user_signed_up
# - user_activated
# - subscription_started
# - subscription_cancelled
# - feature_used
